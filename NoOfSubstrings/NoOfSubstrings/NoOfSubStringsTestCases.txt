1.      Take two strings as input and check whether the second string is a sub-string of the first or not. If yes, print the number of timesoccurredured in S1 and print the index positions
        where the string appeared.

Constraints:
Let S1 is the String and S2 be the Substring
S1,S2 contains lowercase alphabets i.e, S1,S2=[a-z]
S1 should be greater than or equal to the length of S2 i.e, S1>=S2

#TestCase1:
  i/p : S1 = “abcdabcabd”

        S2 = “ab”

  o/p: No.of times occurred = 3

        Index positions = 0 4 7

#TestCase2:
  i/p : S1 = “abcdabcabd”

        S2 = “aa”

  o/p: No.of times occurred = 0

#TestCase3:
  i/p : S1 = “ab”

        S2 = “abc”

  o/p: "The size of the String should be greater than or equal to Substring"
